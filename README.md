# OpenSSE-Guard üõ°Ô∏è

**An open-source Security Service Edge (SSE) proxy for filtering, monitoring, and redirecting HTTP traffic using mitmproxy, Flask, and a React-based admin interface.**

---

## üöÄ Overview

OpenSSE-Guard is a lightweight security tool that intercepts HTTP(S) traffic, analyzes URLs, and applies security policies such as:

- **Blocking malicious or unwanted domains**
- **Redirecting traffic based on security rules**
- **Forwarding requests to a different proxy when needed**

Built with **mitmproxy** and **Flask**, OpenSSE-Guard acts as a dynamic security gateway‚Äîideal for enterprise security, content filtering, and web traffic control.  
*This is a playground project and should probably not be used in production.*

---

## üîπ Features

- **Custom URL Filtering:** Block or redirect requests based on domains, hostnames, or URL patterns.
- **Dynamic Proxy Forwarding:** Reroute requests to another proxy when necessary.
- **Policy CRUD Operations:** Create, read, update (if implemented), and delete policy entries via a RESTful API.
- **React Admin Interface:** Manage policies through a dynamic web interface with filtering, sorting, and add/delete functionality.
- **Security-First Design:** Helps enforce **SSE (Security Service Edge)** policies.
- **Stream Handling & Content Analysis:** Intercepts and processes HTTP responses with content-based rules.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration:** Validate URLs and file hashes against the AlienVault OTX API.

## üîπ Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.7+**
- **mitmproxy** (for traffic interception)
- **Flask** (for the API layer)
- **Node.js & npm** (if using the React admin interface)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/livio-ch/OpenSSE-Guard.git
   cd OpenSSE-Guard
   ```

2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   (Optionally create and activate a virtual environment first.)

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies** (if using the React admin interface):

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

---

## üîπ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root (or backend directory) with content similar to:

```dotenv
OTX_API_KEY=your_otx_api_key_here
DB_PATH=url_filter.db
```

*Tip:* Ensure your `.env` is listed in `.gitignore` to avoid committing sensitive data.

### CORS

The Flask backend is configured to allow requests from `http://localhost:3000`. Adjust this in the Flask code if necessary.

---

## üîπ Running the Application

### Running the Backend (Flask API)

Start the Flask API:

```sh
python app.py
```

This will run the server on `http://0.0.0.0:5000` (or `http://localhost:5000`) in debug mode. The API provides endpoints for managing policies, checking URLs, file hashes, and more.

### Running mitmproxy

Run mitmproxy with your interception script:

```sh
mitmproxy -s api_call_intercept.py
```

Configure your network/browser proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

### Running the Frontend (React Admin Interface)

If you choose to use the provided React admin interface for managing policies:

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```sh
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Start the React app:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to access the policy management interface.

---

## üîπ How It Works

1. **Traffic Interception:**  
   mitmproxy intercepts HTTP(S) traffic.

2. **Policy Evaluation:**  
   The intercepted requests are forwarded to the Flask API, which checks URLs against allowlists, blocklists, and threat intelligence (via OTX).

3. **Policy Actions:**  
   Based on security rules, the proxy will block, allow, or redirect traffic.

4. **Policy Management:**  
   Use the API endpoints (or React admin interface) to manage policies:
   - Add new policies
   - Retrieve existing policies
   - Delete policies
   - (Optionally) Update policies

---

## üîπ API Endpoints

### GET `/get_policy`
Retrieve policy data from a specified table.

- **Query Parameter:**  
  `table` (e.g., `blocked_urls`)
- **Response Example:**
  ```json
  {
    "status": "success",
    "data": [
      ["www.google.com", "domain"],
      ["example.com", "hostname"]
    ]
  }
  ```

### POST `/set_policy`
Add a new policy entry.

- **Expected JSON Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "table": "blocked_urls",
    "data": { "url": "www.google.com", "type": "domain" }
  }
  ```
*Note:* The backend maps the JSON keys to the appropriate database columns.

### DELETE `/delete_policy`
Delete a policy entry.

- **Expected JSON Payload:**
  ```json
  {
    "table": "blocked_urls",
    "condition": "www.google.com"
  }
  ```
If the condition string does not specify a column, the backend assumes the first column (e.g., `value` for `blocked_urls`).

### Additional Endpoints

- **POST `/checkUrl`** ‚Äì Validate a URL against policies and OTX.
- **POST `/checkHash`** ‚Äì Check a file hash against policies and OTX.
- **POST `/checkMimeType`** ‚Äì Validate a MIME type.
- **GET `/logs`** ‚Äì Retrieve log entries.
- *(Optional)* **PUT `/update_policy`** ‚Äì Update an existing policy entry.

## üîπ Deployment

### Frontend Deployment

Build the React app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

This creates a production-ready bundle in the `/build` folder.

### Backend Deployment

For production, consider using a production WSGI server (e.g., Gunicorn) with a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx). Adjust your CORS, logging, and error handling settings accordingly.
